# cesiumlang.org

This repo defines the files used to generate the official [Cesium website](https://cesiumlang.org).

The site is built using [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/), a static site generator for building knowledge gardens.  While Quartz is not natively setup to support generating API documentation, it is our goal to repurpose it for that given its other advantages and features as a generator plus the simplicity of its code.
